This is a final project I completed with two partners for my Applied Stats class.
We were given a data set from 40 seasons of the Survivor TV show.
For our assignment, we used RStudio to determine what factors result in someone winning their season.
We then created a presentation and written report.
I was responsible for coding the age, personality, and number of challenge wins as possible factors.
Additionally, I created the slides and typed the written report for number of challenge wins and personality.
